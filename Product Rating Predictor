# ðŸ“Œ Product Rating Predictor (Beginner Friendly)
# -----------------------------------------------
# This program will:
# 1. Load product rating data from a CSV file
# 2. Train a model to predict ratings
# 3. Test the model with sample input

# Step 1: Install dependencies (Run this only once in terminal)
# pip install pandas scikit-learn

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Step 2: Load your CSV data
# Your CSV should have columns like:
# product_id, price, number_of_reviews, average_review_length, rating
data = pd.read_csv("product_ratings.csv")

# Step 3: Choose features (X) and target (y)
X = data[['price', 'number_of_reviews', 'average_review_length']]
y = data['rating']

# Step 4: Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Step 5: Create and train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 6: Predict ratings for the test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Step 7: Check accuracy using Mean Squared Error
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Model Mean Squared Error: {mse:.2f}")

# Step 8: Try predicting a new product's rating
# Example: Price=500, Reviews=120, Avg Review Length=50 words
new_product = [[500, 120, 50]]
predicted_rating = model.predict(new_product)
print(f"Predicted Rating for new product: {predicted_rating[0]:.2f}")
